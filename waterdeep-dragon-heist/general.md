    * [Chapter 2 Revamp - Tournament Arc](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaterdeepDragonHeist/comments/gydhd5/chapter_2_revamp_tournament_arc/)
      * **Purpose:**
        * Introduce players to factions and important NPC’s naturally
        * Money for Trollskull
        * Include the main plot line through gossip
        * Give a bit more structure to Chapter 2
        * Fights!
        * Why will Dalakhar come to the PC’s for help with the Stone in hand if Renear is not a fan of them?
        * I’ve been struggling with Chapter 2 not knowing how to introduce the factions, important players/villains and keep the main story line included, also, money. I found some great ideas like Mirt inviting the party to the Opera with most of the important NPC's attending – however it did not fit my campaign; why would the nobles/faction leaders find the party interesting from only talking to them and maybe the Renear rescue rumour. My solution follows and is based on Critical roles ‘Victory Pit’ which gives a bit more structure, some combat where the PC’s prove their worth and a reason for why the factions are interested in them as well as introduce them to the Cassalanters, Jarlaxle, Factions etc. Additionally, if your PC’s \(like mine\) have a difficult relationship with Renear, why would he suggest Trollskull as a meeting place to Dalakhar? This gives a reason for Dalakhar to approach the now renown party at Trollskull \(without Renear\) in search of their assistance getting out of the city \(even if this is only known to the DM\). \*Side note that I am running the Alexandrian variant.
      * **The Tournament Arc!**
        * To kick off the \*insert name here\* weeklong festival, a gladiatorial-type group tournament fight is held in an arena located in Casle Ward close to one of the Griffon walking statue. Most of the important nobles and faction leaders attend the reception area where they can view the tournament and are introduced to the brave warriors who will face the beasts. This is an endurance tournament with three rounds between 4 groups against unknown creatures \(see Rules section below\). The 4 teams are comprised of the three main open factions in Waterdeep \(Grey Hands, Lords Alliance & Emerald Enclave\) & one group taken from the public - your PC's. This is to showcase what each faction stands for and a type of ‘friendly’ competition to see who is stronger. \[As with any big gathering the Harpers & Zhents are also doing their part in the competition, sourcing secrets and rumours from the crowd \*possibility to include a side-quest for a Harper, Zhent member\].
      * **Getting into the tournament**
        * The players can hear whispers and see notices of the tournament, with excitement brewing in the streets. The three main faction groups are already selected, and wouldn’t you know it, your PC group was randomly selected as the fourth group after they registered at 20gp per fighter \(or maybe they were the only group who registered, or another faction/NPC pulled some strings to rig the lottery\).
        * \[In my campaign the Wizard is interested in joining an academy and received a letter of recommendation from Volo to Blackstaff Tower. Vajra will explain that her chosen team set for the games is experiencing some delays with their mission, thus asking the players if they can fill in for the Grey Hands at the tournament\].
        * Once the party joins, either via an invite \(like Vajra\) or through registration, their names are published together with the other faction groups. They have a couple of days to prepare. During this time, and as it becomes known who the participants will be, there is an opportunity for the party to be approached by a faction with a side-mission because the party will be in the presence of important people. For example: The Harpers have heard whispers that the Cassalanters are up to something, and Mirt asks a PC to keep a lookout for any letters being delivered to them whilst at the tournament, or a Zhent PC asked to steal something from a noble or intimidate a certain person with a message etc. giving a bit more intrigue to the tournament.
      * **Rules:**
        * On the day of the tournament, the players are greeted by the conductor who explains the rules in more detail \(consider providing the players with a free healing potion or two if they had insufficient funds to buy themselves\):
          * Each faction has a fight with a creature unknown to them.
          * Each faction has to compete in three fights or until they cannot continue.
          * Each fight increases in difficulty.
          * There is a short rest between each fight while the other groups are fighting
          * In the case that someone goes unconscious, Clerics are available to stabilize them before they fail three saves. If the PC is stabilised by a Cleric, that PC have to sit out the rest of the tournament. \[It is both a service and a bit prestigious for the clerics to be at the tournament, possibly rivalry between the different clerics on who can heal better, who has the better god etc. Nobody but them really care though – maybe a mishap ensues when a cleric apprentice heals someone too early\).
          * You can at any time stop the fight \(“what is your safe word?”\) but you will be disqualified.
          * Falling in battle during a round result in the groups elimination.
          * You can withdraw between fights if you feel unable to continue.
          * The Watchful Order of Magists will protect spectators from any AOE damage & deter interference as well as deal with any creatures in the case that you resign during a fight.
          * Each fight you win will grant the party 200gp.
          * The tournament will continue until either the end of the third round where those groups that remained would split among themselves 2000gp, or at an earlier point if it happened that all but one group was left standing in either the first or second round, in which case the prize-money would all go to them.
          * Allowed to use whatever tools, equipment, and weapons they had brought with them in preparation to fight in the arena.
        * Variant: Have the rounds spaced over a couple of days, for sabotage/information gathering opportunities.
      * **Reception:**
        * They are then taken to the reception area where most of the main players in the Grand Game are present;
          * Cassalanters, as philanthropists, are here as sponsors for the event \(on hearing that the PC’s acquired Trollskull they can set up a meeting with the party to discuss funding\),
          * Bregan D’aerthe are in the crowd handing out flyers for the Sea Maiden’s fair happening later during the tournament, but of course Jarlaxle as Captain Zord bribed his way into the reception to mingle with the uppercrust and silently discuss his fabulous nimblewrights at excellent prices.
          * Gralhunds are present possibly talking to Captain Zord or other nobles - wanting to be seen in the company of those above them.
          * Mirt, Vajra, other faction heads, Volo, Renear, the Open Lord and various other nobles are present to meet the PC’s \(with the exception of the Zhetarim & Xanathar guilds - they’ve had enough screen time in Chapter 1\).
          * This is also a good space to introduce a nimblewright owned by one of the nobles.
          * City Guards also present to ensure everything remain amicable, possible inclusion of personal guards.
        * Gossip, intrigue and plans can be overheard if you are listening carefully – good time to drop some hints that something is brewing with the Grand Game even if the details are a bit shoddy.
      * **The Tournament:**
        * There are three rounds for each faction.
        * Each faction, lottery style \(roll 1d4 and assign names\), will have a chance to go to the pit and fight a creature. Once their fight is complete another faction will go etc. giving the PC’s a chance to ‘recover’ with a short rest between fights. It will be good to have some obstacles \(broken pillars etc\) in the arena to make the fight more interesting.
        * \[I am not a fan of describing a fight my PC’s are not involved in, so the other groups success/failure will be determined by avg of three d100 rolls. DC to be determined by the DM \(ex: above 40 for first fight, above 60 for second, above 80 for third\).\]
      * **Possible monsters to consider**:
        * Allegedly found wandering the ranges of Faerun terrorizing the area, several creatures were acquired, caged by other adventurers/factions, kept secret under guard until revealed as challenges for fighting groups competing in the tournament. Stick to stuff that makes sense but also a great opportunity for the DM to have a bit of fun, really want to run that obscure creature but the scenario never makes sense? Tada!
        * Pick creatures with increasing CR difficulty ratings for each fight. Make four/three groupings \(depending on how many groups you have\). My 5 players are level 4 because lvl 1 is boring as hell to start a campaign on.
        * It will run something like this:
          * The conductor will announce the start of the tournament, thank the Open Lord and welcome the crowd. "Now ladies and gentlemen, we will start the first Round with the fiersome Grey Hands!" The Grey Hands \(Group 1\) will come into the arena and decide their placement. "Handlers, release the creature!". All four doors on the corners of the area open up at the same time, you see out of the South door a creature emerge, an Otyugh, and it is charging right at you. Roll for initiative. After the battle, the party return to a staging area. "Congratulations to the Grey Hands, next in line, the Emerald Enclave", they fight the Giant Crocodile after which the Lords Alliance fight the Bannderhobb.. "That is the end of Round 1, let's welcome back the Grey Hands", they fight the Winter Wolves... etc etc
        * Group 1 \(my pc group - Grey Hands\):
          * Round 1: Otyugh
          * Round 2: Winter Wolves x2
          * Round 3: Hill Giant
        * Group 2. \(Emerald Enclave\):
          * Round 1: Giant Crocodile
          * Round 2: Displacer Beast
          * Round 2: Wyvern
        * Group 3 \(Lords Alliance\):
          * Round 1: Banderhobb
          * Round 2: Minotaurs
          * Round 3: Ice Troll
      * **End of Tournament:**
        * Whether the party win or lose, they get a bit of gold as well as recognition, making it easier for factions to approach them. They are now also known and know the main players so that if you’d like a meeting to happen between them it becomes possible – especially if they drop that Trollskull is now theirs. Also, PC’s like fights!

        * [Waterdeep Prison System](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaterdeepDragonHeist/comments/j6kptp/waterdeeps_prison_system/)
          * **Courthouses:**
            * A permanent _antimagic field_ surrounds the courthouse and does not block _zone of truth_ due to _wish_.
            * _Zone of truth_ is cast on the prisoner when they are speaking in court.
            * The prisoner's legs are tied to a chair. They also have their arms bound behind the chair.
          * **Prisons:**
            * A permanent _antimagic field_ that does not block _arcane lock_ due to _wish_ surrounds the prison.
            * Doors to high-value areas such as the exit to the prison, the doors to the armoury, and the door leading out of the cellblock have _arcane lock_ cast on them.
            * If the prisoner is being moved anywhere that is not their cell, they are restrained as described in Procedures &gt; Transport to and from a place.
          * **Procedures:**
            * Transport to and from a place
              * The prisoner is transported by a caravan if the destination is another city.
              * Arms are bound behind the back with manacles. Hands are covered with a bag tied around the wrists to prevent somatic components or pickpocketing.
              * The mouth is covered with a cloth tied around the head.
              * _Dimensional Shackles_ are used on the convict's ankles if transported via a caravan to a different city.
            * Arriving at the courthouse
              * All of the prisoner's items are taken.
              * The prisoner is given a yellow hoodless, pocketless robe with laceless leather shoes and cloth underwear.
              * The prisoner is held in a temporary holding cell in a courthouse until sentencing.
            * Sentencing
              * If the convict is sentenced to death, their body is cremated. The dust is securely stored to prevent resurrection and necromancy. The criminal's name is entered into a do not resurrect list \(see miscellaneous\).
          * **Miscellaneous:**
            * Clerics in Waterdeep that perform resurrection services that can cast _true resurrection_ are given an updated do not resurrect list of executed criminals from the city watch. This prevents executed criminals from being revived with _true resurrection_.
            * Regular guards use **Veteran** stat blocks.
            * The Lord's Alliance employs spies, diplomats, and assassins around various cities, so being a wanted criminal and fleeing Waterdeep may not guarantee safety.
