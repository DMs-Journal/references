      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>An almost American Ninja Warrior obstacle course proved to be the most
          popular attraction, with a 3 gold entrance fee and a pot containing said
          entrance fee for whoever completed it. The competition was comprised of
          3 skill checks.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The players could attempt either athletics or acrobatics for the first
          check, with a DC of 10.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>For the second skill check, the obstacle would be something intentionally
          tricky and possibly disorienting, so they&apos;d be given the option of
          Fast or Slow; for Fast, they roll at disadvantage, but the DC is only 12.</p>
        <p>If they go Slow, they roll once for a DC of 15.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>For the third skill check, it would be some sort of hybridized challenge
          between the two physicality stats. So, they could either make an Acrobatics
          or Athletics check, DC 17, or they could make two skill checks, one Athletics
          and one Acrobatics, DC 13 for the &apos;dominant&apos; skill and 10 for
          the &apos;secondary&apos; skill.</p>

        Cult of Asmodeus, they could become a target for random street violence.
        If they aren&apos;t affiliated with the party, you could also use an NPC
        that might be known to the players, such as Yagra Stonefist.</td>

      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>This encounter is pretty much entirely fluff. A music performance or some
          other form of a demonstration is happening, and the characters can enjoy
          it. Feel free to have them be bards who are putting magic into their music
          to create special effects, or swords dancers, acrobatics, animal trainers.
          Sneak in references to bands your players like.</p>
        <p>If you need a little extra spice, those urchin children may be making
          their way through the crowd picking pockets. Unfortunately for them, a
          noble has figured them out and has sent one of his bodyguards to grab one
          of them he sees; the deaf girl, Nat. Players can either help catch the
          urchins or keep them from getting caught in the confusion of the crowd.</p>

      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>A shop selling mundane goods, such as weapons, adventuring supplies, flowers,
          or food. This is mostly a fluff encounter, but you could make things interesting.
          For example, two of my characters are from Kara-Tur, so I created an imported
          clothing store that happened to have both genuine Kozakuran garments, as
          well as imitations; the originals costed more. This could be a haggling
          opportunity for the players.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I also created a bard-painter, who used magic to enhance their painting
          abilities. They would accept a deal to spend one minute sketching you per
          gold piece given to them. Give them 25, you get 25 minutes for them to
          speed draw a caricature of your character</p>

      <td style="text-align:left">The Gondian Arcade:</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>The goal of the game is to inflict 60 points of &apos;damage&apos; on
          the pinball machine, which translates to the score. You roll using your
          intelligence or dexterity modifier, no proficiency. The number you roll
          determines how many dice you use to add to your score.</p>
        <p>0-5: Miss, Lose Your Ball
          <br />6-10: 2d4
          <br />11-15: 3d4
          <br />16-20+: 4d4
          <br />Natural 20: 7d4</p>
        <p>I also ruled that players could use class abilities if they figured out
          how to incorporate them cleverly. If you allow this, set higher goals and
          perhaps expand the margin for Ball Loss. I made a rule that any magical
          effect (faerie fire, hexblade&apos;s curse) would wear off on the machine
          after 2 rounds due to the magical nature of the construction, and that
          they could only use class features (sneak attack, stunning strike, horde
          breaker) a number of times equal to their proficiency bonus. They performed
          better than I expected, so you may wish to tweak these rules, either expanding
          the margin for error or lowering the &apos;damage&apos; outputs, but I
          feel the game goes too slowly otherwise.</p>

      <td style="text-align:left">Magical item vendor/fortune teller:</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>A mysterious deep purple tent that contains a few magical items, safeguarded
          by an old item vendor who also tells fortunes. I rolled 2d4 times on Magic
          Item Table F; most of the items were so expensive the players either had
          to haggle or take loans if they wanted to purchase anything.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Fortune telling can be useful if you&apos;re planning out individual arcs
          for characters, or to foreshadow a single main arc up ahead, but plan these
          out ahead of time. I used tarot for this, so if you were going to transition
          into Curse of Strahd, you could use the mechanics from that.</p>

Fenerus Stormcastle, the lamplighter who receives the Stone of Golorr, still makes a duplicate and that is stolen by the Xanathar Guild after Stormcastle is arrested. However, instead of the tower, Fenerus hid the stone inside the casing of a lamp, as he'd have easy access to it, and be able to pick it up without seeming suspicious whenever he wanted. Unfortunately for our heroes, he hid the stone in a lamp in the dock wards. Specifically, Mistshore. Where I decided the Sea Maiden's Faire was going to be put on. 

The characters had visited Mistshore before, so seeing it prettied up for the fair would be pleasant, and give them a sense of permanence to Waterdeep, instead of it feeling like there's just a new location every time there's an event. I decided that the fair would run for 7 days and that each day you would be marked by a magical stamp. Anyone who collected all seven stamps would be put into the drawings of a grand prize, which I have yet to actually finalize. 

For the fair, I made the following encounters, rolling on a d10. A character could also forgo the roll to voluntarily seek out something that any member of the party had already seen. 

As for the actual stone, it is located in a random lamp somewhere within the festivities. They can attempt to retrieve the stone during the day or the night, but it may lead to complications with the law, or perhaps a chase as a dock worker or a fair employee finds it first, or worse, a member of the Bregan D'earthe.
